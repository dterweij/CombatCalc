# CombatCalc
Webversion of the Combat Calculator for Operation New Earth strategical game.



## Local Served

As we don't want to make a user account system so bad people can mess arround and see other players data, we decided at 
first hand to host this website localy on your PC along with your personal game data. So only the player have the data
on its local PC and not hosted on the bad wide open internet :-)

This website shall be hosted with WAMP. A tool that installs a webserver, database and the language we wrote this
website in (PHP).

In the future we can always decide otherwise. We are not professionals. We do this as a hobby and for most of all the fun.
